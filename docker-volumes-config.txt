# Docker volume mount configuration for labels storage
# Add this to your docker-compose.yml:

# volumes:
#   - ./storage/labels:/var/www/html/storage/labels:rw

# This ensures that:
# 1. The labels directory is mounted from the host
# 2. Both host and container can read/write labels
# 3. Labels persist even if container is recreated
# 4. Host can access downloaded PDF files directly

# Alternative: Use a named volume for better portability
# volumes:
#   labels_storage:
#
# services:
#   app:
#     volumes:
#       - labels_storage:/var/www/html/storage/labels

# For Linux containers, ensure correct permissions:
# RUN chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/storage/labels
# RUN chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/storage/labels
