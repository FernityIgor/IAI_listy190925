 Step-by-Step Installation Guide
Step 1: Check Your PHP Version
Open XAMPP Control Panel
Click "Admin" next to Apache, or go to http://localhost/phpinfo.php
Create a file called phpinfo.php in your htdocs folder with this content:
<?php phpinfo(); ?>

Note down your PHP version (e.g., 8.1, 8.2, 8.3)

Step 2: Download the SQL Server Driver
Go to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/php/download-drivers-php-sql-server
Or direct download: https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/releases
Download the latest version that matches your PHP version

Step 3: Extract and Copy Files
Extract the downloaded zip file
Find the files that match your PHP version:
For PHP 8.1: php_sqlsrv_81_ts.dll and php_pdo_sqlsrv_81_ts.dll
For PHP 8.2: php_sqlsrv_82_ts.dll and php_pdo_sqlsrv_82_ts.dll
For PHP 8.3: php_sqlsrv_83_ts.dll and php_pdo_sqlsrv_83_ts.dll
Copy these 2 files to your XAMPP PHP extensions folder:
Usually: ext

Step 4: Edit php.ini
Open php.ini in a text editor
Find the section with other extension= lines

Add these lines (replace 82 with your PHP version):
extension=php_sqlsrv_82_ts
extension=php_pdo_sqlsrv_82_ts

Step 5: Install Visual C++ Redistributable
The SQL Server driver requires Visual C++ Redistributable:

Download from: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
Install it
Restart your computer if prompted
Step 6: Restart XAMPP
Stop Apache in XAMPP Control Panel
Start Apache again
Check if it loads without errors
